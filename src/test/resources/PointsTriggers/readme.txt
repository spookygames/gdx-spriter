This Spriter file has the following metadata examples:

1) Both the "throw_knife" and the "throw_axe" animations have action points that appear at the apropriate part of the animation, which should give the game engine the spawning location and angle at which to create the projectile sprites.

2) Both of the animations also include triggers ("ThrowKnife" and "ThrowAxe") at the same moment the action points appear to tell the game engine to spawn the projectiles at that exact moment.
